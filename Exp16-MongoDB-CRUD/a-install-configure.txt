Experiment 16(a): Install MongoDB and Configure Atlas

Theory:
MongoDB is a NoSQL document database. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service for deploying, managing, and scaling MongoDB clusters.

Steps:
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new cluster (choose free tier if available).
3. Configure your cluster (region, name, etc.).
4. Add a database user and set a password.
5. Whitelist your IP address to allow connections.
6. Get your connection string (URI) for use in applications.

You can also install MongoDB locally from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
